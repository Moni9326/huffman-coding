Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm.
It assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters. 
This method was developed by David A. Huffman and is widely used in data transmission and file compression. 
By analyzing the frequency of each character in the input, Huffman coding reduces the overall size of the data without losing any information.
